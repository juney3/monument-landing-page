                    I have to push the pram a lot. Burn her! I'm not a witch. Did you dress her up like this? Why? Well, she turned me into a newt. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

                    I dunno. Must be a king. But you are dressed as one… Well, we did do the nose. Oh, ow! Now, look here, my good man. Well, I got better. Found them? In Mercia?! The coconut's tropical! The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. We found them. Bring her forward! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!

                    Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. And that is not how I'm introducing myself. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.

              You don't believe in the Force, do you? What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. He is here. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. I call it luck. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now.
            </p>

              It's such a long way from here. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I'm trying not to, kid. Red Five standing by. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. What!? I'm trying not to, kid. He is here. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!
